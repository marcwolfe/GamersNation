## User Stories

As a user the goal is to be able to view my games. I want to be able to add new games, reviews, and ratings etc. I want to be able to remove games from my list as well.

## MVP Goals

- Pictures of each game
- Place for Discord community link for the game of choice

## Stretch Goals

## Things to come back to

- Apply better CSS to make website look more clean
- Add links to different places to purchase the games
- Make it so you can add a review to a game that already has a review and updates it so you see both reviews
