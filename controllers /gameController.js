          review: "This is a decent Call of Duty title in terms of gameplay. There are some flaws with this game that seems to be every year. They never release the game with a league play mode to cater to the competitive players which can be frustrating for a lot of players. They also realease the game with multiple game breaking glitches and bugs which destroys the integrity of the gameplay. Most importantly though HACKERS, they have to do something effective to stop the hackers! "

The expansive catacombs of Hallownest have countless paths to explore and secrets to find. But more than that, its rich with lore, history, and purpose that drew me into a 2D Metroidvania kingdom I wanted to uncover every inch of. The deeper I went into Hollow Knight, the more I was surprised at just how much content and freedom it has to offer. I could wander in basically any direction and find bosses to fight, upgrades to collect, and secrets to uncover. But whats truly captivating about the exploring this long-dead kingdom is its atmosphere. Art, music, color tone, sound, and a million other little details combine to give each area of the map a distinct sense of place, and those areas jigsaw together in a way that feels intentional and alive."
